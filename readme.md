# HOW TO LEARN. Student project for Yandex.Practicum

## Description

One page layout of a simple landing about study methologies.

This project gave a chance to train my layouting skills in HTML and CSS, practice different ways to position elements within a page and learn how to create simple animations.

Layout was made according to the [brief](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HyRXtvfmQBiZGARttWNdWEENEO-U7fP/view?usp=sharing) provided by the course and the visual mockup was to be recreated within a 20px tolerance.

File structure was to be organised according to BEM-methodology.
